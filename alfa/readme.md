# NATO Phonetic Versioning

Use a spelling alphabet to **delineate** the **accretion** of your software.

### Delineate

Use a unique namespace. Put a N.P.V. term at a consistent branching point. Start with `alfa`.

```
com.my-name.my-project.alfa.api
```

> Is it time for whatever *new version* means to you and your software's community?

```
com.my-name.my-project.bravo.api
```

Order matters. Practice in the shower or while listening to CIA shortwave.

```
alfa
bravo
charlie
delta
echo
foxtrot
golf
hotel
india
juliett
kilo
lima
mike
november
oscar
papa
quebec
romeo
sierra
tango
uniform
victor
whiskey
xray
yankee
zulu
```

> What's beyond `zulu`?

```
com.my-name.my-project.alfa-alfa.api
```

> But doesn't `alfa` mean *alpha*?

Nope. `alfa-alfa` is just the term after `zulu`. *Alpha* is a social contract between you and your community.

### Accretion

Leave previous code in place and intact.
